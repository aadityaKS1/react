 for more information.

npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This will copy all configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you have full control.

All commands except eject will still work, but now you manage everything manually.

For small to medium projects, ejecting is usually not needed.

Features

Add, edit, and delete tasks.

Theme customization with multiple color schemes.

Tasks are saved in localStorage for persistence.

Simple and clean user interface.
